  abstract = "Awareness of poor design and published concerns over study
              quality stimulated the development of courses on experimental
              design intended to improve matters. This article describes some
              of the thinking behind these courses and how the topics can be
              presented in a variety of formats. The premises are that
              education in experimental design should be undertaken with an
              awareness of educational principles, of how adults learn, and of
              the particular topics in the subject that need emphasis. For
              those using laboratory animals, it should include ethical
              considerations, particularly severity issues, and accommodate
              learners not confident with mathematics. Basic principles,
              explanation of fully randomized, randomized block, and factorial
              designs, and discussion of how to size an experiment form the
              minimum set of topics. A problem-solving approach can help
              develop the skills of deciding what are correct experimental
              units and suitable controls in different experimental scenarios,
              identifying when an experiment has not been properly randomized
              or blinded, and selecting the most efficient design for
              particular experimental situations. Content, pace, and
              presentation should suit the audience and time available, and
              variety both within a presentation and in ways of interacting
              with those being taught is likely to be effective. Details are
              given of a three-day course based on these ideas, which has been
              rated informative, educational, and enjoyable, and can form a
              postgraduate module. It has oral presentations reinforced by
              group exercises and discussions based on realistic problems, and
              computer exercises which include some analysis. Other case
              studies consider a half-day format and a module for animal
              technicians.",
