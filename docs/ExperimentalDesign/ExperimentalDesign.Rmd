## Deciding on an Experimental Question

## Ethical Considerations
Ethical considerations are integral to the initiation, conduct, and publication of experimental results.  In terms of experimental design, consider the following *3Rs* [@Fry2014-wu].

- Replacement

- Refinement

- Reduction

## Ethical Considerations

### Replacement
Does the experiment need to be performed at all or performed as envisioned?

- Literature review
    - Has the study already been done?
    - What designs have been used or proposed for similar experiments in the past?
- Are the experimental materials appropriate for the questions at hand?
    - Cell lines useful instead of animals
    - Low cost tech instead of high cost (PCR vs. Sequencing)

## Ethical Considerations

### Refinement
Does the experiment as envisioned gather appropriate data, have defined stopping rules, standard procedures, and clarity on sources of variability?

- Define important data to gather.
    - Dependent variables and independent variables may not be enough.
    - Consider confounders, technical details, ambient conditions, and metadata (date, time, machine, experimenter, etc.).
- Define when an experiment is "complete". 
- Establish standard procedures as clearly as possible.
- Define, to the extent possible, sources of variability and reliability in your approach.

## Ethical Considerations

### Reduction (or is the experiment right-sized)
Can the experiment provide reasonable results with the resources proposed?

- Is sample size appropriate?
- Are resources allocated appropriately?
- Are data sources not directly produced by the experiment included?
- Meta-analysis appropriate?

## Why design?

- To obtain valid results *from which safe and meaningful conclusions can be drawn*
- To know the extent to which results can be generalized
- To use resources efficiently
    - Overpowering (using more than required resources) and, to a greater extent, underpowering can be very costly.

# Hypothesis testing

## The Normal distribution

```{r echo=TRUE}
x = rnorm(10)
mean(x)
sum(x)/length(x)
sd(x)
```

## The Normal Distribution

```{r}
plot(x)
```

## The Normal Distribution

```{r}
x = rnorm(1000)
hist(x)
```

## Students t-distribution

Represents the distribution of the estimate of the mean of a normal distribution when the mean is small.

```{r}
rn3 = sapply(1:100,function(x) return(mean(rnorm(3))))
rn20 = sapply(1:100,function(x) return(mean(rnorm(20))))
summary(rn3)
summary(rn20)
```

## Students t-distribution

- Two distributions of the mean of our "population"
    - One with 20 samples
    - One with 3 samples

```{r eval=FALSE}
plot(density(rn20),col='blue',xlim=c(-2,2))
lines(density(rn3),col='red')
```

## Students t-distribution

```{r echo=FALSE}
plot(density(rn20),col='blue',xlim=c(-2,2))
lines(density(rn3),col='red')
```

## Two groups -- Population distribution


```{r}
g1 = rnorm(10000,1)
g2 = rnorm(10000,0)
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
plot(density(g1),col='blue',xlim=c(-4,5))
lines(density(g2),col='red')
```
## Two groups -- Population distribution

```{r echo=FALSE}
plot(density(g1),col='blue',xlim=c(-4,5))
lines(density(g2),col='red')
```

## Two groups -- estimate of mean

What distribution do we use to estimate the mean?

```{r}
g1_3 = sapply(1:100,function(x) return(mean(rnorm(3))))
g2_3 = sapply(1:100,function(x) return(mean(rnorm(3,1))))
```

```{r}
g1_20 = sapply(1:100,function(x) return(mean(rnorm(20))))
g2_20 = sapply(1:100,function(x) return(mean(rnorm(20,1))))
```

## Two groups -- estimate of mean

```{r echo=FALSE}
plot(density(g1_20),xlim=c(-2,3),col='red')
lines(density(g2_20),col='red')
lines(density(g1_3),col='blue')
lines(density(g2_3),col='blue')
```

## Effects of population "spread" or standard devation

```{r}
g1 = rnorm(10000,1,2)
g2 = rnorm(10000,0,2)
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
plot(density(g1),col='blue',xlim=c(-4,5))
lines(density(g2),col='red')
```

## Two groups -- Population distribution

```{r echo=FALSE}
plot(density(g1),col='blue',xlim=c(-4,5))
lines(density(g2),col='red')
```

## Two groups -- wider population spread

What distribution do we use to estimate the mean?

```{r}
g1_3 = sapply(1:100,function(x) return(mean(rnorm(3,0,2))))
g2_3 = sapply(1:100,function(x) return(mean(rnorm(3,1,2))))
```

```{r}
g1_20 = sapply(1:100,function(x) return(mean(rnorm(20,0,2))))
g2_20 = sapply(1:100,function(x) return(mean(rnorm(20,1,2))))
```

## Two groups -- wider population spread

```{r echo=FALSE}
plot(density(g1_20),xlim=c(-2,3),col='red')
lines(density(g2_20),col='red')
lines(density(g1_3),col='blue')
lines(density(g2_3),col='blue')
```

## Power

*Power* is the statistical probability that a test will reject the null hypothesis when the null hypothesis is *actually false*.

```{r}
install.packages('pwr')
# d is the "effect size"
pwr.t.test(n=10,d=1)
```

# Basic Principles of Experimental Design

## Controls

## Replication

- Need estimates of centrality (mean) AND spread (variance)

## Randomization and Avoidance of Bias

- No batch effect

$$ y_i = \beta_1X_{1,i} + \epsilon$$

$\beta_1$ is the estimate of the mean (or difference of means) of treatment. 

- One "batch"

$$ y_i = \beta_1X_{1,i} + \beta_2X_{2,i} + \epsilon$$

$\beta_1$ is the estimate of the mean (or difference of means) of treatment. 
$\beta_2$ is the estimate of the mean of the batches. 


## Randomization and Avoidance of Bias

```{r}
df = data.frame(expression=rnorm(12),
                treatment = rep(c(0,0,0,1,1,1),2),
                batch = c(rep(0,6),rep(1,6)))
df
```

## Randomization and Avoidance of Bias

```{r}
df = data.frame(expression=rnorm(12),
                treatment = c(0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0),
                batch = c(rep(0,6),rep(1,6)))
df
```
